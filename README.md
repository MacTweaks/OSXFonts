*custom fonts must use the same format and file name as the default font*

1. In /System/Library/ search for a folder called ProtectedFonts and delete the default font which should be LucidaGrande.ttc

2. Then from /System/Library/Fonts you can replace LucidaGrande.ttc without it being automatically replaced

3. Replace the deleted font in /System/Library/.../ProtectedFonts with the custom font

4. Log out to see changes
